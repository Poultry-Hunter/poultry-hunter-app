## Description

While the Poultry supply chain becomes more complex, the **Rapid Tracing of bird diseases** like bird flu becomes **near to impossible**, in most cases it takes <u>months</u>! And long tracing time leads to:

1. **Significant loss** to the <u>entire supply chain</u>.
2. **Delay** in <u>containment</u>.
3. And above all **increase in disease transmission** both in humans and birds.

Complexity in the food-related Supply chains also introduces <u>economic inefficiency</u> at every point of transactions, be it a poultry farmer or a distributor.


Therefore, a decentralised system is required that tracks every point of Poultry transaction with an intuitive rather technology minimal medium that can trace bird disease as well as maximise efficiency in operations at every level, from Poultry farm to Chicken Butcher/seller.

 Introducing **Poultry Hunter**, a **blockchain-based** farm to butcher/seller <u>chicken tracker</u> that **rapidly traces bird flu** while also providing a <u>platform</u> to **maximise operational efficiency**.
