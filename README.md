## What is Poultry Hunter?

While the Poultry supply chain becomes more complex Rapid Tracking of bird diseases like birds flu becomes near to impossible, in most cases it takes months! And long tracking means a significant loss to the entire supply chain for a certain period, delay in containment, and above all increase in disease transmission both in humans and birds.

A system is required which decentrally tracks every point of Chicken transaction with an intuitive rather technology minimal medium for one-click rapid bird disease tracing.

Introducing Poultry Hunter, a blockchain-based farm to butcher tracker that rapidly traces bird flu. In order to have a foolproof system, Poultry Hunter maximizes platform enrollment by providing a marketplace to Poultry farmers and cuts down on distributors' labor cost
